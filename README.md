# SegmentDisplayConfigurator
A free Lazarus code explorer for the control TSegmentDisplay of package LEDControls.

The project depends on package BGRABitmapPack.

Installation

Pull all files to a local folder like "SegmentDisplayConfigurator",
install the package BGRABitmapPack
and compile the package ledcontrols.lpk and install it.

I developed it with Windows 10 64-bit. Please try it under Linux or macOS and let me know
if it works (it should). jan@atomek.de, www.atomek.de
